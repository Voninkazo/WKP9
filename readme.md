Hey team!
After a major graded project, let's do something different, and a little bit more straightforward.
Today weâ€™re going to build a list of the Studio Ghibli Movies, ranked from best to worst. If you havenâ€™t seen any of those, I suggest you to look on the Onja hard drive! (after completing the project of course). They are amazing âœ¨

The website will look similar to this :

![assets/ghibli.png](assets/ghibli.png)

You will fetch the data from this URL [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films)

and display the result in the HTML. The film needs to be sorted depending on their rt_score!

There is a lot of data in a film object, use whatever attribute you need.

Feel free to add some beautiful styling to your website when you're done fetching and sorting the data.

Good luck ðŸ’»

 In this project, I managed to generate the data from the url(data source) and set some css in the design. But there is a little bit of problem because I have an error in the console which I couldn'manage to find out why it is there. I hope the explanation durig the correctio will help me solve it. Thank you so much Loic. It was fun, first time of fetching exercise practice.
 Overall, it was quite sraightforwrad.
